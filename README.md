# MLB Salary Prediction Application

Welcome to my source code for my Streamlit application for my Salary Prediction for MLB Batters and Pitchers. 

- This application utilizes a machine learning algorithm that generates predictions for a MLB batter or pitcher based on user inputs for a single season. Additionally, predictions for 2022 season end statistics are also incoorporated into the prediction models.
